          <h2> GO HAWKSSS</h2>
          <p> I first found my love of football and the NFL in 2012 right when i turned 10, I heard lots of people talk about it so i gave it a try.
             My team was and still is the Seahawks, watching footbal every sunday gave me joy! and it so happened that we were actually pretty good.
            My favorite moment was the Trash Talk Richard Sherman used to do. </p>
          <p> After every sunday night game we had i would always search up "Richard Sherman Trash talk" on Youtube, This video would pop up every time
            <a href="https://youtu.be/nZH036vMS2s" target="_blank"> and it was this.</a>
          <p> Whenever The game was on i had all my gear and lights to the blue and green. Later when i got older i got into fantasy football
            I would use <a href="  https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/" target="_blank">   https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/</a> and it became my new addiction.
          </p>
