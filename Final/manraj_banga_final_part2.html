          <h2>1. What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
          <p>I perviously had no knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript, i knew the concept of javascript but had never have heard of HTML and CSS.
I didn't know how to find things or read code either.Â </p>
          
          
          <h2>2. Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
          <p>At first when doing that Midterm i had used a templete from our past M03 assignment, but when i got to the final i switched it up and made my own from scratch.</p>
          
          
          <h2>3.What was your most challenging part of your portfolio </h2>
               <p>CSS was my main problem, the content and everything was fine but when it came to resizing moving positioning and etc it started to become difficult.  </p>
          
          
          <h2>4. How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h2><p>By understanding the terminology in HTML, CSS, Javascript it helped identify how websites are made. I thought making a website was vary hard but after this course i can say it is easy if you have the time for it, it is very time consuming but easy at the same time some people that do work in this profession, hats off to you for dedicating your time to it. </p>
          
          
          <h2>5. What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
          <p>TIME. you need time for this class, becuase the speed that someone works at isnt the speed you work at an understand. Learning the terms is crucial to work on stuff in thsi class and understanding it as well.  </p>
